_Last updated: 2025-09-05 13:13 UTC_

## Project Status & Milestones

- This file is the authoritative record of project progress.
- Statuses: **Not Started**, **In Progress**, **Complete**.
- Updated after every substantive change.

### Milestone 1: Core Backend Functionality
- [x] **Tutor Questions API Endpoint** — Fully implemented. Accepts reviewed lecture content, returns structured learning objectives and tutor questions. Each question includes mandatory difficulty, tags, and references.
- [x] **LLM Prompt Update** — Prompt fully rewritten for clarity and strict requirements. Enforces British English, question structure, and metadata.
- [x] **Backend Models & Parsing** — Data models and parsing logic updated to strictly validate all required fields.

### Milestone 2: Required Features
- [x] **Tags Support** — Tags are now a required, validated field for every question.
- [x] **Difficulty & Hint** — Difficulty is mandatory, hint is optional but encouraged.
- [x] **Multi-Modal Reference** — Questions reference slides, sections, images, tables, and external sources.

### Milestone 3: Testing & Validation
- [x] **Automated Testing** — Unit test for `/generate-tutor-questions` endpoint is complete. Structure, required fields, error states, and edge cases validated.
- [x] **Manual QA** — Complete. All required scenarios validated (see MANUAL_QA_TUTOR_QUESTIONS.md). Ready for frontend integration.

### Milestone 4: Frontend & API Integration
- [x] **Frontend Display** — ✅ COMPLETE. Enhanced UI displays all metadata: tags, references, learning objectives, MCQ formatting with stem/options/explanation. Comprehensive error and loading states implemented.
- [x] **API Documentation** — ✅ COMPLETE. Full endpoint documentation with input/output examples, error states, and integration notes (see docs/API_INTEGRATION.md).
- [x] **Production API Integration** — ✅ COMPLETE. Frontend now uses `/tutor-questions` endpoint with robust error handling for network, validation, and model errors.
- [x] **Accessibility & Responsiveness** — ✅ COMPLETE. Full screen reader support, keyboard navigation, responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop.
- [x] **Complete Metadata Display** — ✅ COMPLETE. All fields visible and labeled: stem, options, answer, explanation, tags, difficulty, reference, hint. No missing/null fields in UI.

- [ ] **Model Expansion** — Will test with multiple models for best results.
- [ ] **Quality Assessment** — Implement feedback mechanisms and quality metrics for generated questions.

### Milestone 6: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] **Production Deployment** — Code will be containerized and deployed on cloud provider.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Security** — Logging, error reporting, usage analytics, security measures to be implemented.

### Milestone 7: Future Features
- [ ] **Additional Question Types** — Matching, ordering, image-based, free-text.
